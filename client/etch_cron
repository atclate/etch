# Run the etch client every hour
# If you want to disable etch updates do NOT comment out this cron job.
# Out next client update will just put it back anyway.
# Instead create /var/etch/disable_etch and add a comment as to
# why this box shouldn't be getting updates.  Etch will notice
# that file and abort.  disable_etch files with no comment will be
# removed by the System Administration team without warning.
