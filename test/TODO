FIXME: Seems like we could restructure this so that the server is just started
as needed (i.e. for the first test that runs) and then the config repo is
cleaned out and recreated as needed. That should speed up the test runs quite
a bit, and reduce the occurrence of the occasional timing-related failures
where the server doesn't finish starting up before we unleash the client.

Restructure so that tests can run in local or server mode
