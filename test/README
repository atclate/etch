To execute all tests run "rake test".
To execute the tests in a specific file run "rake test TEST=test/file.rb".
To execute a specific test method run
  "rake test TEST=test/file.rb TESTOPTS='--name=test_files'"

To force a particular XML library set xmllib=libxml or xmllib=rexml in
your environment before running the tests.

Some of the older files here have all of their tests in one method. Over
time I'm breaking those up into multiple methods so that it is easier to
run a specific test when debugging an issue. New test cases should be
placed in their own test method. It makes running individual tests for
debugging much more pleasant.
