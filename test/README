To execute all tests run alltests.rb

You can also run the individual .rb test files to test specific areas.

To force a particular XML library set xmllib=libxml or xmllib=rexml in
your environment before running the tests.

Some of the older files here have all of their tests in one method. Over time
I'm breaking those up into multiple methods so that it is easier to run a
specific test when debugging an issue. New test cases should be placed in
their own test method. It's a bit slower because the server has to be started
up for each method, but it makes running individual tests for debugging much
more pleasant.
